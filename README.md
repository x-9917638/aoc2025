# 2025 Advent of Code
2025 AoC solutions, written in Rust using only the standard library :3

If you want to see my explanations, either look in the part 2 solution of each day, 
or look at my [writeups]() (TBA).

I'm a complete beginner in Rust so please don't judge ;-;

Each day is its own workspace, please `cd` into the directory before using `cargo run --bin <PART>`.

If you want to try my solutions, please put your own inputs at `day*/input.txt`
